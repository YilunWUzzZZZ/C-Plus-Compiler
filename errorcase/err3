For other error cases, I couldn't able to reproduce same problem with smaller
program. May be some optimizations are happening while many registers are being
used. So, here I am pointing out the issues.


In chess.c+, if we remove two print statement in line no 173 and 176, global
variable doesn't get updated.


If we dont add two statements in line no 604 and 605, then the "if" of line
661 loads wrong values (always 0) for parameters "r1" and "c1"


also, 
some compound if structures were not working back to back, so I had to add
garbage statements in between them. Like in the function "pawn" in line 601.
